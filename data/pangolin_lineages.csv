Lineage	Notes
A	Root of the pandemic lies within lineage A. Many sequences originating from China and many global exports; including to South East Asia, Japan, South Korea, Australia, the USA and Europe, represented in this lineage
A.1	A North American lineage (BS=16)

A.4	Lineage circulating in USA (BS=100)
A.5	A lineage with a lot of representation from Spanish-speaking countries. A majoritively Spain/ South-American lineage, low bootstrap (16) but historically has had high support. 
A.6	Lineage in Thailand (BS=65)
A.7	Indian lineage, previously A.p7. Some in A.p7, including Saudi Arabian & Turkish sequences reassigned to A (BS=100)
